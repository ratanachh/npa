# Phase 7: Missing Implementation Summary

**Last Updated**: December 2024

**Latest Updates**:
- ✅ Fixed ORDER BY clause bug - now correctly uses column names from `[Column]` attributes
- ✅ Fixed foreign key column detection bug - `GetForeignKeyColumnForOneToMany` now only matches FK properties, not navigation property names
- ✅ Fixed multi-level navigation bug - now extracts relationships from intermediate entity instead of current entity, ensuring correct FK column usage
- ✅ **Fixed SQL injection vulnerability** - `GetColumnNameForProperty` now validates property names and returns safe default instead of unsanitized input
- ✅ Implemented Complex Filters (OR/AND combinations for relationship queries)
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for bug fixes (70+ total relationship query tests including security test)

## Overview

---

## Phase 7.6: Missing Features

### ✅ What's Implemented
- ✅ Basic navigation query methods (`FindBy{Property}IdAsync` for ManyToOne)
- ✅ Relationship existence checks (`Has{Property}Async` for OneToMany)
- ✅ Basic count methods (`CountBy{Property}IdAsync`, `Count{Property}Async`)
- ✅ **Property-based queries** (`FindBy{Property}{PropertyName}Async` - e.g., `FindByCustomerNameAsync`)
- ✅ **Aggregate methods** (`GetTotal{Property}{PropertyName}Async`, `GetAverage...`, `GetMin...`, `GetMax...`)
- ✅ **GROUP BY aggregations** (`Get{Property}CountsBy{ParentEntity}Async`, `GetTotal{Property}{PropertyName}By{ParentEntity}Async`, etc.)
- ✅ **Advanced filters** (date ranges, amount filters, subquery-based filters)
- ✅ Efficient SQL queries (no N+1 problems)
- ✅ Correct column name handling (uses `[Column]` attributes in JOIN, ORDER BY, and WHERE clauses)
- ✅ Type-safe key handling (supports different key types)
- ✅ **Complex Filters**: OR/AND combinations (`FindBy{Property1}Or{Property2}Async`, `FindBy{Property}And{PropertyName}Async`)
- ✅ **Security**: SQL injection protection in configurable sorting - only validated property names are used in ORDER BY clauses
- ✅ **Bug fixes**: ORDER BY clause now uses column names; FK column detection correctly identifies FK properties; SQL injection vulnerability fixed in `GetColumnNameForProperty`

### 📋 What's Still Missing

#### 1. GROUP BY Aggregations ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ **Implemented**: `GetOrdersCountsByCustomerAsync()` - Returns `Dictionary<int, int>`
- ✅ **Implemented**: `GetTotalOrdersTotalAmountByCustomerAsync()` - Returns `Dictionary<int, decimal>`
- ✅ **Implemented**: `GetAverageOrdersTotalAmountByCustomerAsync()`, `GetMin...`, `GetMax...`
- **Remaining**: Multi-entity GROUP BY queries (with JOINs across multiple relationships)
- **Example**:
  ```csharp
  // ✅ Now implemented
  Task<Dictionary<int, int>> GetOrdersCountsByCustomerAsync();
  Task<Dictionary<int, decimal>> GetTotalOrdersTotalAmountByCustomerAsync();
  // 📋 Still planned: Multi-entity GROUP BY with JOINs
  Task<IEnumerable<(int CustomerId, string CustomerName, int OrderCount, decimal TotalAmount)>> 
      GetCustomerOrderSummaryAsync();
  ```

#### 2. Advanced Filters ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ **Implemented**: Date range filters on relationships
  ```csharp
  // ✅ Now implemented
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindByCustomerAndOrderDateRangeAsync(
      int customerId, 
      DateTime startOrderDate, 
      DateTime endOrderDate);
  ```
- ✅ **Implemented**: Amount/quantity-based filters
  ```csharp
  // ✅ Now implemented
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindCustomerTotalAmountAboveAsync(
      int customerId, 
      decimal minTotalAmount);
  ```
- ✅ **Implemented**: Subquery-based filters
  ```csharp
  // ✅ Now implemented
  Task<IEnumerable<Customer>> FindWithMinimumOrdersAsync(int minCount);
  ```

#### 3. Pagination and Sorting Support
- ✅ **Implemented**: Skip/Take parameters for collection queries
  ```csharp
  // ✅ Now implemented
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindByCustomerIdAsync(int customerId, int skip, int take);
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindByCustomerNameAsync(string name, int skip, int take);
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindByCustomerAndOrderDateRangeAsync(
      int customerId, DateTime startOrderDate, DateTime endOrderDate, int skip, int take);
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindCustomerTotalAmountAboveAsync(
      int customerId, decimal minTotalAmount, int skip, int take);
  Task<IEnumerable<Customer>> FindWithMinimumOrdersAsync(int minCount, int skip, int take);
  ```
- ✅ **Implemented**: Configurable sorting (orderBy and ascending parameters)
  ```csharp
  // ✅ Now implemented
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindByCustomerIdAsync(
      int customerId, 
      int skip, 
      int take,
      string? orderBy = null, 
      bool ascending = true);
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindByCustomerNameAsync(
      string name, 
      int skip, 
      int take,
      string? orderBy = null, 
      bool ascending = true);
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindByCustomerAndOrderDateRangeAsync(
      int customerId, 
      DateTime startOrderDate, 
      DateTime endOrderDate,
      int skip, 
      int take,
      string? orderBy = null, 
      bool ascending = true);
  ```

#### 4. Multi-Level Navigation ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- ⚠️ **Partially Implemented**: Basic 2-level navigation queries (e.g., OrderItem → Order → Customer)
- **How It Works**: The generator extracts relationships from the intermediate entity (e.g., `Order`) using `ExtractRelationships` to find its relationship to the target entity (e.g., `Customer`). This ensures the correct foreign key column is used from the intermediate entity's relationship metadata.
- **Bug Fix**: Previously, the code incorrectly searched for the second-level relationship in the current entity's relationships. This has been fixed to extract relationships from the intermediate entity, ensuring correct FK column usage and respecting custom `[JoinColumn]` attributes.
- **Limitation**: Requires successful relationship extraction from the intermediate entity. If the relationship cannot be extracted (e.g., due to compilation/metadata issues), the query method will not be generated. This is intentional to prevent incorrect SQL generation.
- **Example**:
  ```csharp
  // ⚠️ Partially implemented - generates when relationship extraction succeeds
  Task<IEnumerable<OrderItem>> FindByOrderCustomerNameAsync(string customerName);
  // Navigates: OrderItem → Order → Customer
  // Uses Order's relationship to Customer (with correct JoinColumn if specified)
  ```

#### 5. Complex Relationship Filters ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ **Implemented**: OR combinations in relationship queries
  ```csharp
  // ✅ Now implemented
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindByCustomerOrSupplierAsync(
      int? customerId, 
      int? supplierId);
  ```
- ✅ **Implemented**: AND combinations with entity properties
  ```csharp
  // ✅ Now implemented
  Task<IEnumerable<Order>> FindByCustomerAndStatusAsync(
      int customerId, 
      string status);
  ```

#### 6. Inverse Relationship Queries ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ **Implemented**: Find entities with/without related entities
  ```csharp
  // ✅ Now implemented (on Customer repository)
  Task<IEnumerable<Customer>> FindWithOrdersAsync();
  Task<IEnumerable<Customer>> FindWithoutOrdersAsync();
  Task<IEnumerable<Customer>> FindWithOrdersCountAsync(int minCount);
  ```

## Notes

- **Phase 7.5 (Orphan Removal)** appears to be complete based on its README, but the comprehensive review document shows it as "planned". This may be a documentation inconsistency that should be resolved.

- **Property-based queries, aggregate methods, GROUP BY aggregations, advanced filters, pagination support, configurable sorting, and inverse relationship queries** were recently implemented (December 2024) and are fully tested (57 relationship query tests passing, including 5 tests for fully qualified type name bug fixes).

- **Bug Fixes**: Four critical bugs were fixed:
  1. ORDER BY clause now correctly uses column names from `[Column]` attributes instead of property names
  2. Foreign key column detection now only matches FK properties (ending with "Id"), not navigation property names
  3. Multi-level navigation now correctly extracts relationships from intermediate entities instead of current entity, ensuring correct FK column usage
  4. **Security Fix**: SQL injection vulnerability in `GetColumnNameForProperty` - now validates property names and returns safe default instead of unsanitized input

- All missing features are enhancements to Phase 7.6. The core Phase 7 functionality (7.1-7.5) is complete and production-ready.

- **Test Coverage**: Phase 7.6 now has 70+ comprehensive unit tests covering:
  - Basic relationship queries (ManyToOne, OneToMany)
  - Property-based queries
  - Aggregate methods (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
  - GROUP BY aggregations
  - Advanced filters (date ranges, amounts, subqueries)
  - Pagination and sorting
  - Inverse relationship queries
  - Multi-level navigation (2-level navigation with relationship extraction)
  - Complex filters (OR/AND combinations)
  - Security (SQL injection protection in configurable sorting)
  - Bug fixes (column name handling, FK column detection, multi-level navigation FK extraction, SQL injection vulnerability)
